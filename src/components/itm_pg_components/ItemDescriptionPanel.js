                  Disclaimer: The description below only applies when the item is an apple, we are working on other descriptions. <br/>
                    It's some sort of apple, you might get a variety you like, you might not. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.<br/>
                    Of course, this apple is definitely not for eating, you get to rent it as decoration for up to 3 days! <br/>
                    If you return it when it's rotten you'll have to purchase the entire apple...
